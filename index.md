# About Me

I am a PhD candidate at Tel Aviv University. I work in the Deep Learning Lab under the supervison of Prof. [Lior Wolf](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/). I am mainly interested in unsupevised, semi-supervised and self-supervised learning. Much of my work focuses on generative models, image to image translation and domain adaptation. I am also interested in security aspects of machine learning.
